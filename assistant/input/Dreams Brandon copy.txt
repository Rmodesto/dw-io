Do
you
ever
wonder
what
your
dreams
mean?
Dreams
can
be
puzzling
and
sometimes
seem
to
make
no
sense
at
all.
In
this
blog
post,
I
will
explore
the
world
of
dreams
from
a
Jungian
perspective.
Dreamwork
is
a
way
of
exploring
the
unconscious
mind
through
dreams.
Jungian
dreamwork
(or
Jungian
dream
analysis)
is
based
on
the
work
of
Swiss
psychiatrist,
Carl
Jung.
Jung
believed
that
dreams
are
a
way
for
the
unconscious
mind
to
communicate
with
the
conscious
mind.
He
also
believed
that
dreams
are
symbolic
and
can
have
multiple
meanings.
To
do
dreamwork,
it
is
important
to
keep
an
open
mind
and
look
at
dreams
from
different
perspectives.
Dream
Recall
The
first
step
in
doing
Jungian
dream
analysis
is
to
recall
your
dreams.
This
can
be
easier
said
than
done.
Dreams
can
be
fleeting
and
disappear
as
soon
as
you
wake
up.
Here
are
some
tips
to
help
you
recall
your
dreams:
●
Get
a
good
night’s
sleep.
It’s
important
to
go
through
all
the
stages
of
sleep
in
order
to
dream.
Dreams
occur
during
both
REM
(rapid
eye
movement)
and
non-REM
sleep,
but
we
remember
dreams
better
when
we
wake
up
from
REM
sleep.
●
Set
an
intention
to
remember
your
dreams.
Before
you
go
to
bed,
take
a
few
minutes
to
relax
and
set
the
intention
to
remember
your
dreams.
This

can
be
done
by
simply
focusing
your
attention
on
the
dreams
you
would
like
to
remember.
●
Wake
up
gradually.
When
you
wake
up
in
the
morning,
take
a
few
minutes
to
sit
up
in
bed
and
recall
your
dreams.
Instead
of
thinking
forward
about
what
you
need
to
do
today,
think
backward
about
what
was
just
happening
in
your
dreams.
●
Keep
a
dream
journal.
Write
down
your
dreams
as
soon
as
you
wake
up,
and
include
as
many
details
as
possible.
Include
the
emotions
you
felt
in
the
dream
as
well
as
any
symbols
or
images
that
stand
out
to
you.
You
may
also
use
a
voice
recorder
if
you
prefer.
Jungian
Dream
Analysis
&
Interpretation
Once
you’ve
recalled
your
dreams,
you
can
start
interpreting
them.
Jung
believed
that
dreams
are
a
way
for
the
unconscious
mind
to
communicate
with
the
conscious
mind.
That’s
why
it’s
important
to
keep
an
open
mind
when
interpreting
dreams.
Here
are
some
tips
to
interpret
your
dreams:
●
Reflect
on
your
dreams.
After
you
have
written
down
your
dreams,
take
some
time
to
reflect
on
them.
What
do
you
think
they
mean?
What
are
the
symbols
and
images
trying
to
tell
you?
Try
to
look
at
your
dreams
from
different
perspectives
and
see
what
insights
you
can
gain.
●
Look
for
patterns
and
symbols.
As
you
look
at
your
dreams,
see
if
there
are
any
patterns
or
symbols
that
stand
out
to
you.
These
may
be
things
that
have
personal
meaning
to
you.

●
Think
about
what
the
dream
might
mean.
After
you
have
identified
any
patterns
or
symbols
in
your
dream,
take
some
time
to
think
about
what
they
might
mean.
What
is
the
dream
trying
to
tell
you?
●
Share
your
dreams
with
someone
else.
After
you
have
explored
your
dreams
on
your
own,
you
may
want
to
share
them
with
someone
else.
This
could
be
a
friend,
family
member,
therapist,
or
dream
group.
Sharing
dreams
can
be
a
helpful
way
to
gain
new
insights.
Here
are
some
questions
to
ask
yourself:
●
What
is
the
overall
feeling
of
the
dream?
●
What
did
you
see
in
the
dream?
●
What
did
you
hear
in
the
dream?
●
Who
was
in
the
dream?
●
What
happened
in
the
dream?
●
How
did
you
feel
in
the
dream?
After
you
have
asked
yourself
these
questions,
take
some
time
to
journal
about
your
dreams.
Write
down
your
thoughts
and
feelings
about
the
dreams.
You
may
also
want
to
draw
pictures
to
represent
your
dreams.
Jung
used
the
method
of
amplification
to
understand
dreams.
To
do
this,
he
would
take
a
symbol
or
image
from
a
dream
and
amplify
it
by
doing
research
on
the
meaning
of
the
symbol.
This
might
come
from
myths,
fairytales,

or
folklore.
By
amplifying
dreams,
we
can
gain
a
deeper
understanding
of
their
meaning.
There
are
three
types
of
meaning
to
consider:
 
Personal.
Give
your
personal
associations
to
symbols
in
the
dream.
For
example,
if
you
dream
about
a
house
you
lived
in
when
you
were
younger
you
may
have
childhood
memories
associated
with
a
specific
time
your
life.
 
Cultural.
Once
you’ve
thought
about
personal
associations,
you
can
look
at
cultural
meanings
of
the
symbols
in
your
dream.
For
example,
the
eagle
in
American
culture
may
represent
freedom,
while
in
Native
American
cultures
it
could
represent
strength,
wisdom,
and
courage.
 
Archetypal.
Lastly,
consider
the
archetypal
meaning
of
dream
symbols.
These
are
the
universal
meanings
of
symbols
that
are
found
in
all
cultures.
For
example,
water
may
represent
emotions
or
the
unconscious
mind.
