Dream
Mind

Why
do
we
dream?
How
do
dreams
provide
insight
into
the
mind?
Are
dreams
relevant
to
waking
life?
From
ancient
times
when
dreams
were
considered
to
hold
prophetic
powers
to
the
neurological
phenomena
studied
today ,
dreams
remain
one
of
psychology’ s
most
enduring
mysteries.
Although
scientists
continue
to
research
the
answers
to
these
questions,
they
build
their
work
on
some
commonly
accepted
dream
theories.

Defined
as
a
series
of
thoughts,
visions
or
feelings,
dreams
arise
several
times
per
night
during
sleep.
As
a
process,
sleep
is
cyclical.
It
occurs
in
five
stages,
each
helping
to
further
the
body’ s
goal
of
bolstering
and
regenerating
itself.
While
stages
1-4
are
simply
named
as
such,
the
fifth
stage
is
called
Rapid
Eye
Movement,
or
REM.
It
makes
up
about
20
to
25
percent
of
adult
sleep.
The
REM
stage
is
the
most
common
time
of
dreaming
,
explains
the
National
Sleep
Foundation.
Dreams
themselves
usually
last
between
a
few
seconds
to
30
minutes
in
length.
On
average,
people
dream
about
four
to
six
times
per
night,
with
adults
dreaming
about
two
hours
for
every
eight
hours
of
sleep.
In
addition
to
its
association
with
dreams,
the
REM
stage
is
a
time
when
the
body
processes
information,
creates
memories
and
increases
depleted
chemicals,
such
as
serotonin.
Although
the
necessity
of
sleep
has
long
been
observed,
only
in
recent
history
did
people
consider
that
dreams
may
also
serve
a
utilitarian
function.
F o u r

The
past
two
centuries
have
given
rise
to
four
of
the
most
commonly
accepted
dream
theories.
S i g m u n d
F r e u d

W i s h - F u l ﬁ l l m e n t

The
famous
psychoanalyst
Sigmund
Freud
was
the
first
to
suggest
that
dreams
may
serve
a
particular
scientific
purpose.
He
came
to
believe
that
dreams
were
often
a
form
of
wish-fulfillment
,
the
American
Psychoanalytic
Association
says.
In
a
dream,
a
subject
could
act
out
desires
he
or
she
could
not
fulfill
in
waking
life.
Some
types
of
dreams,
however ,
proved
problematic
within
this
model,
such
as
dreams
involving
punishment
or
traumatic
events.
These
led
Freud
to
believe
that
dreams
sometimes
served
as
a
way
for
patients
to
express
guilt
or
conquer
trauma.
All
these
conjectures
played
into
Freud’ s
overall
(and
revolutionary)
theory
of
dreams:
that
they
were
manifestations
of
unconscious
workings
of
the
brain.

Although
Freud
and
Carl
Jung
were
contemporaries,
they
disagreed
strongly
(and
famously)
about
the
nature
of
dreams.
Freud
believed
that
dreams,
by
nature,
disguised
their
meaning.
In
contrast,
Jung
believed
that
dreams
were
actually
direct
expressions
of
the
mind
itself
.
Dreams,
he
thought,
expressed
an
individual’ s
unconscious
state
through
a
language
of
symbols
and
metaphors.
This
“language”
was
natural
to
the
unconscious
state,
but
difficult
to
understand
because
it
varied
so
much
from
waking
language.
Notably ,
Jung
also
believed
that
universal
archetypes
(or
images)
intrinsic
to
all
human
consciousness
existed
within
this
language.
He
believed
that
dreams
served
two
functions:
to
compensate
for
imbalances
in
the
dreamers’
psyche,
and
to
provide
prospective
images
of
the
future,
which
allowed
the
dreamer
to
anticipate
future
events.

Yet
another
theory
arose
with
the
discovery
of
REM.
The
Activation-Synthesis
theory
was
conceived
by
Harvard
professors
Allan
Hobson
and
Robert
McCarley
in
the
1970s,
explains
Joe
Griffin
of
the
Human
Givens
Institute.
Hobson
and
McCarley
discovered
that
during
REM
sleep,
electrical
signals
called
electroencephalogram
recordings,
or
EEGs,
pass
through
the
brain.
They
theorized
that
the
brain
naturally
reacted
by
attempting
to
make
sense
of
the
random
stimulus.
Thus,
dreams
had
no
intrinsic
meaning;
they
were
just
a
side
effect
of
the
brain’ s
normal
activity .
While
this
theory
was
revolutionary
at
the
time,
the
continual
advancement
of
technology
has
led
to
tremendous
revision
of
this
theory .
