Humans

since
the

of
the
E gyptians
and

Bab ylonians,
wher e
it
was
belie v ed
that
dr eams

messages

the

Still

dr eams

often

mystical
and
metaphysical
qualities,
supposedly
enabling

t o
pr edict

or

Their

can

the

or
just

and
dr eams
often
stir

emotions

which

linger
with

for
a

after

In

science
and

Dr eam
analysis,
also
known
as
dr eam
interpr etation,
is
the
act
of
assigning
meaning

and
making

of
a

What
exactly
is
psy choanalysis?
V er y
br oadly ,
this
theor y
tells
us
that
our
thoughts,
f eelings,
beha viors,
and
personalities
ar e
aff ected
b y
the
unconscious
–
that
par t
of
the
mind
which
we ’r e
not
consciously
awar e
of.
The
contents
of
the
unconscious
ar e
thought
t o
be
abstr act,
illogical
and
diﬃcult
t o
understand:
fantasies,
symbols,
memories,
emotions,
instincts,
desir es
and
of
course,
dr eams.

F r om

F or

this
is
a

The

Within

dr eam
analysis,
each
of
which
was
for war ded
b y
two
of
psy chology ’ s
most
famous
ﬁgur es,
who
we
discuss
below .
S i g m u n d
F r e u d
Sigmund
F r eud
liv ed
fr om
1856
t o
1939.
He
was
a
Viennese
neur ologist
and
the
de v eloper
of
psy choanalysis.
He
spent
most
of
his
lif e
in
Vienna,
but
in
1938
he
mo v ed
t o
the
United
Kingdom
t o
escape
the
Nazis.
In
1899
he
published
The
Interpr etation
of
Dr eams
.
F r eud’ s
ideas
continue
t o
inﬂuence
psy chology
t oda y .
The
F r eudian
school
belie v es
that
the
unconscious
is
ﬁlled
with
experiences
that
we
‘r epr ess’
(i.e.
unknowingly
push
out
of
our
awar eness)
because
of
their
distr essing
or
shameful
content
–
usually
socially
unacceptable
impulses
r elated
t o
sex
or
aggr ession.
What
does
this
mean
for
dr eam
analysis?
F r eud
belie v ed
that
the
symbols
and
emotions
in
our
dr eams
can
help
us
t o
understand
the
cause
of
our
pr oblems
in
lif e,
including
r elationship
diﬃculties
and
sympt oms
of
mental
illness.
C a r l
J u n g
Carl
Jung
was
a
psy chiatrist
and
psy choanalyst
fr om
Switz erland.
Born
in
1875,
he
work ed
extensiv ely
with
F r eud.
Jung’ s
dr eam
analysis
theor y
was
initially
inﬂuenced
b y
F r eud’ s,
but
Jung
went
on
t o
publish
his
own
theor y ,
the
Psy chology
of
the
Unconscious,
in
1912,
which
cr eated
a
massiv e
rift
between
the
two
analysts.
The
Jungian
school
diff ers
fr om
the
F r eudian
school
in
terms
of
how
the
unconscious
is
viewed
and
how
dr eam
analysis
is
conducted.
F or
example,
Jung
belie v ed
that
our
dr eams
contain
symbols
fr om
the
collectiv e
unconscious
–
ideas
and
symbols
(called

ar chetypes)
that
ar e
shar ed
b y
all
people
acr oss
cultur es.
F or
Jungians,
ther efor e,
dr eam
analysis
is
about
r ecognizing
these
symbols
and
linking
them
t o
one ’ s
personalities
in
or der
t o
disco v er
how
t o
fulﬁll
one ’ s

Most
forms
of
dr eam
analysis
begin
in
the
same
wa y:
after
describing
y our
dr eam
t o
y our
ther apist,
the
two
of
y ou
will
work
t ogether
t o
identify
the
salient
themes
in
y our
dr eam.
Y our
ther apist
ma y
also
ask
questions
t o
elicit
other
themes
that
ar e
potentially
r ele v ant,
and
in
describing
y our
dr eam
t o
y our
ther apist
often
y ou
will
be
able
t o
r ecall
other
aspects
of
the
dr eam
that
y ou
hadn ’t
initially
r emember ed.
Dr eams
ar e
said
t o
ha v e
two
la y ers
of
meaning:
manif est
and
latent
content.
Manif est
content
r ef ers
t o
the
abo v e-mentioned
themes
that
ar e
clear
and
ob vious,
while
latent
content
r ef ers
t o
mor e
subtle
meanings
and
associations.
F or
example,
if
y ou
dr eam
of
y ourself
ﬂying,
the
manif est
content
is
ﬂight,
while
the
latent
content
is
the
meanings
that
y ou
attach
t o
ﬂight:
liber ation,
lightness
and
childhood
memories
of
ﬂying
y our
kite,
for
example.
By
using
their
knowledge
of
y ou
as
a
person,
as
well
as
other
psy chological
techniques
which
we
describe
below ,
y our
ther apist
will
help
y ou
t o
determine
the
latent
content
in
y our
dr eam
and
t o
understand
what
this
might
mean
for
y our
lif e.
