1. Introduction
In my role as a counselor educator at the University of Tex -
as-Pan American, I regularly include dream analysis training 
as part of my group counseling classes. For a topic that is 
optional, dream analysis is by far the most popular subject 
that I cover during the semester.  I introduce dream work 
in the context of our full-class sessions, comprised of 16-

process. During the second half of the course, I introduce 
several advanced methods during our full-class sessions, 
including dream work. Thereafter, students are encouraged 
to incorporate dream work into their own small groups,

Given the enthusiasm expressed by these graduate stu -
dents, one might think that training future counselors in 
dream analysis would be a straightforward process of in -troducing one or more of the most commonly employed 
therapeutic dream work methods, such as the Hill Method 
(Hill, 1996), the Interview Technique (Delaney, 1993, 195-
240; 1996), or the Story Telling Method (Diccico, 2007) for 
individual therapy, or the Ullman method (Ullman and Zim -
merman, 1985; Ullman, 1996) for group work. However, in 
my experience there is a perceived mismatch between the 
philosophy and goals of contemporary psychotherapy, and 
the objectives of dream analysis as it is often understood by 
untrained therapists. 
The Problems Inherent in Teaching Dream Work to 
Counselors in Training
Studies have shown that dream analysis results in deeper 
work in the early sessions of therapy (Diemer,, Lobell,  Vivi -
no, and Hill, 1996), produces superior client outcome mea -
sures when compared with self-esteem and insight work 
(Falk and Hill, 1995), and increases self-disclosure and ex -
ploration (Provost, 1999). Understandably, such outcomes 
depend somewhat on the clients‚Äô level of trust and enthu -
siasm toward dream sharing (Knox, Hill, Hess, and Crook-
Lyon, 2008), as well as the therapist‚Äôs interest and active 
solicitation of dream sharing (Hill and Rochlen, 2004).

age of practicing psychotherapists actively solicit dream 
reports from their clients.  In one study, only 13 percent of 
the therapists employed dream analysis on a regular basis 
(Keller, Brown, Maier, Steinfurth, Hall, and Piotrowski, 1995). 
Another survey (Schredl, Bohusch,  Kahl, Mader, and Some -
san, 2000) of German psychotherapists indicated that while 
respondents used dreams in 28 percent of their sessions, A new method of dream analysis congruent with

it may still impede the adoption of dream analysis by modern psychotherapists. Add to that a psychotherapist‚Äôs lack of 
training and concomitant discomfort with his or her own dreams and it is no surprise that dream work utilization remains 
low. Drawing on an array of theoretical, clinical, and empirical sources, this paper presents a view of normal dreaming as 
an interactive process between the dreamer and the dream imagery, and views the dream outcome as a co-determined 
or co-created experience. By shifting the focus in dream analysis away from content to interactive process, a counselor 
view the dream in such a way as to support the goals of contemporary therapy. By adopting this paradigm, he or she 
can assist clients in discerning  the dream ego‚Äôs responses to the dream content, and evaluate how these re-sponses

spread adoption of dream analysis by psychotherapists. The author presents a case example of employing an approach 
to dream analysis consistent that is congruent with the goals of many of the schools of modern psychotherapy

their clients initiated the dream work twice as often than the 
therapists did.  And in a more recent study (Crook and Hill, 
2004), 92 percent of therapists surveyed claimed that they 
worked with dreams at least occasionally, but only 15 per -
cent had worked with a client‚Äôs dream during the previous 
year. 
The low utilization of dream work in therapy may be due, 
in part, to therapists‚Äô lack of training and competency in 
dream analysis, and a concomitant discomfort in discussing 
client dreams, as well as their own. However, the absence 
of dream analysis in therapy may also be attributable to the 
still-popular view that dreams are entirely synonymous with 
their visual content, and that dream analysis only involves 
an interpretation of the imagery. While this content intrepre -
tive view has been largely overturned by modern dream re -
search, it still has deep roots our cultural heritage. Indeed, 
traditional hermeneutics is grounded in the theory of mimet -
ics (Sontag, 1966), which has its origins in ancient Greece. 
In her famous essay Against Interpretation, Sontag provides 
a critique that is still relevant to our consideration of dreams 
today:

The focus on interpreting the content of one‚Äôs experience 
independent of subjective, contextual and relational con -
siderations is a well recognized problem in contemporary 
psychotherapy (Young, 2008, p. 144), and is eschewed by 
a variety of modern schools. For instance, counselors who 
practice within an existential or client-centered framework 
consider interpretation to be of minimal importance in the 
therapeutic process, preferring instead to foster the quali -
ties of here-and-now self-awareness, choice, and personal 
responsibility in their clients. Similarly, cognitive-behavioral

thinking and acting, which are central to their paradigm.  
Meanwhile, therapists who practice systemic or relational 
therapies, and who favor an analysis of relational process 
over intrapsychic content, might be deterred from explor -
ing dreams because of the presumed absence of any in -
teractive process in dreams. Regardless of the particular 
theoretical rationale embraced by the practitioner, Egan‚Äôs 
description of the goal of the modern counseling process 
being to ‚Äúhelp clients manage their problems in living more 
effectively and develop unused or underused opportunities 
more fully‚Äù Egan (2007) shifts the focus in counseling away 
from a retrospective, intrapsychic interpretation toward a 
client-centered, competency- and action-based orientation, 
in which the dreamer is supported and held accountable for 
his or her contribution to a dynamic relational process.
In this paper, I review factors that can account for the

nary dreams (Kahan and LaBerge, 2010). On the basis of 
this foundation, one can reasonably view the dream as 1) 
BOJOUFSBDUJWFSFDJQSPDBMFYDIBOHFCFUXFFOBSF√¶FDUJWFBOEactive dream ego, and the dream content, and 2) indeter -
minate from the outset, and co-determined through the in -
terplay between the dream ego and the emergent dream 
content. This orientation allows for the autonomous charac -
ter of dream content, but permits an analysis and trouble -
TIPPUJOHPGUIFESFBNFHPnTSFTQPOTFTUPUIFESFBNrrBOE
by implication, to waking life, as well. This dreamer-focused 
methodology maps onto a therapeutic process that in -
tends to promote greater self-awareness, responsiveness, 
and accountability. In reviewing the basis for a co-creative 
dream theory, I will discuss how dream analysis can draw on 
concepts and methods that are currently used in psycho -
therapy, and thus be more easily incorporated into modern 
practice. Finally,  I will outline and demonstrate a systematic 
approach to dream analysis based on this model. 
The Dream as an Interactive, Constructed Process
Approaching the dream as an interactive or constructed 
experience requires that we treat the dream ego and the 
dream content as independent contributors to the experi -
ence. Instead of asking content-oriented questions such as, 
‚ÄúWhat does this image mean,‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat is this dream saying 
to you?‚Äù a dream facilitator who adopts a co-creative model 
would track the dream ego‚Äôs interaction with the imagery 
through the course of the dream. Further, the dream facili -
tator would ideally ask ‚Äúprocess questions‚Äù (Bowen, 1978) 
such as, 
What feelings or thoughts prompted your reactions?
How did you respond to what was presented?  
How could you have responded differently?  
What do think would have happened if you had respond -
ed differently?
This shift in perspective does not come easily to novice 
dream facilitators, who may still be laboring under the popu -
lar conception of dreams as visual content only. Thus, before 
I introduce dream work methods to my graduate counseling 
students, I ask them to list the questions that a counselor 
might ask of a client who has just reported a dream. Predict -
ably, they list, ‚ÄúWhat does this dream mean to you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat 
do you think this dream is telling you?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat does this 
symbol or image mean to you?‚Äù
I go on to ask my students to list the questions that a 
counselor would ask of a client who has just reported a sig -
OJ√•DBOUXBLJOHFYQFSJFODF5IFZQSFEJDUBCMZMJTUTVDIRVFT -
tions as, ‚ÄúWhat did you feel when‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you think 
about‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat did you want to do?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat happened 
when you‚Ä¶?‚Äù 
After they make this list, I point out the differences between 
the two approaches, and ask them if they would customarily 
encourage a client to interpret a recent experience, or try to 
√•HVSFPVUBOPUIFSQFSTPOnTUIPVHIUTPSNPUJWFT5IFZBHSFF
that such an approach would distract the client away from 
his or her own capabilities and resources. I point out that by 
encouraging clients to ‚Äúinterpret‚Äù everything and everyone 
that is external to the dream ego, we unwittingly foster a 
passive relationship to the dream experience in which the 
dreamer‚Äôs choices and actions are easily overlooked. Such 
an orientation contradicts the prevailing  therapeutic ideal 
of encouraging greater self-awareness, responsibility, and 
agency toward life experiences. 
I close my introduction by suggesting to them that we 
would do well to undertake a similar dreamer-centered ap -

cally from the results of our dream work, but that we need a 
method that will help us in this endeavor. 
The Immediate Advantages of a Dreamer-Focused 
Approach
None of the prevailing dream work methods (Delaney, 1993, 
195-240; 1996; Diccico, 2007; Hill, 1996; Ullman, 1996; 
Ullman and Zimmerman, 1985) deny an active role for the 
dream ego. However, neither do they focus principally on 
the co-determined nature of the dream outcome, nor fea -
ture methods for exploring and modifying the dream ego‚Äôs 
responses to the dream content. At the risk of creating a 
straw man, I believe it‚Äôs important to emphasize the differ -
ences between well-established methods and the method

modern psychotherapy 
While a dreamer-focused inquiry represents a departure 
from a content-oriented approach, it generates an approach 
to dream analysis that is congruent with contemporary 
DPVOTFMJOHPCKFDUJWFT4QFDJ√•DBMMZJUGPTUFSTBOFYQMPSB -
tion of the dream ego‚Äôs subjectivity, including awarenesses, 
choices, and responses. Further, it analyzes the dream -
ing self‚Äôs responses for evidence of chronic patterns and/
or emerging competencies, and  examines responses and 
content changes in light of ‚Äúcircular causality‚Äù or reciprocity 
(Bertalanffy, 1968; Weiner, 1948), which is the ‚Äúgoverning 
principle of relationships‚Äù according to Nichols (2010). This 
emphasis on circular causality honors the relational empha -
sis in systemic therapies and maps the interactive process 
onto general waking scenarios. This naturally leads to the 
formulation of a plan of action that respects the emphasis in 
action-oriented therapies for actual behavior change as the 
principal fruit of the therapeutic process.

The validity of employing co-creative dream theory as a 
framework for understanding ordinary dreams ultimately 
depends on the answer to the question, Can the ordinary 
dream be regarded as an interactive process between a

analysis of the dreamer-dream interactive process in every

from a single case study of a client‚Äôs dreams in therapy,  
Rossi posited a ‚Äúco-creative‚Äù view of dreaming in which the 
synthesis of new identity takes place through the interac -
tion and dialogue between the dreamer and dream imagery. 
According to Rossi, dreamer self-awareness manifests to 
some extent in virtually every dream, such that there is ‚Äúa 
continuum of all possible balances of control between the 
autonomous process and the dreamer‚Äôs self-awareness and 
consciously directed effort‚Äù (1972, p. 163). 
In his initial work, Rossi (1972) never mentioned the term 
lucid dreaming, which is not surprising given the fact that it 
was not until the late 60s that Van Eeden‚Äôs work (1913) was 
brought into public awareness (Green, 1968; Tart, 1968). 
Subsequent writers (Gackenbach & LaBerge, 1988; Kelzer, 1987; LaBerge,1980, 1985; Sparrow, 1976) demonstrated 
that some dreamers, at least, were capable of becoming

ney‚Äôs (1993a) review of contemporary approaches to dream

lucid dreaming as synonymous with dream control, which 
is a common misconception (Flowers, 1993, p. 251).  While 
Delaney‚Äôs work is dated, it appeared over a decade after 
lucid dreaming was established as a REM-correlated phe -
nomenon (Hearne, 1978; LaBerge, 1982), and two decades 
after Rossi (1972) introduced his co-creative dream theory.

context of various strategies for changing unpleasant dream 
endings (p. 110-120), but stops short of incorporating a co-
created view of the dream‚Äôs formation. 
Lucid dream researchers may have undermined lucid 
dreaming‚Äôs broader impact on dream analysis by minimizing 
the importance of the dream imagery in favor of emphasiz -
ing the lucid dreamer‚Äôs virtually unlimited powers.  While this 
emphasis on the dreamer‚Äôs powers may compensate for the 
traditional neglect of the dreamer, it overlooks the possibility 
that the dream can be seen as an interactive process be -
tween functionally independent systems, both of which may 
deserve equal consideration in the analysis of dreams.  In 
contrast to these one-sided perspectives, cocreative dream 
theory acknowledges the role of dreamer awareness and 
responsiveness, while maintaining a view of the dream im -
agery as a somewhat autonomous creation. By regarding 
the dream as an interactive process, co-creative theory pre -
serves a relational orientation to the dream experience 
Some researchers have disputed this view of the dream

is temporarily withheld in dreaming (Cicogna and Bosinelli, 
2001) to allow for the consolidation of new information into 
long-term memory. Weinstein, Schwartz, and Ellman, (1988) 
found support for this hypothesis in the discussion of their 
research.  However, other studies have found evidence

Co-creative dream theory is congruent with the idea es -

its own structure, direction, and climax (or lack thereof); 
but co-creative theory takes it a step further. It views the 
dream narrative not as a single story, but as a relational

story overlooks the impact of the dreamer‚Äôs feelings, beliefs, 
values, and reactions through the course of the real-time 
encounter, and other possible outcomes that could have 
resulted. From the standpoint of co-creative theory, the 
dream worker must introduce the idea that the dream ego

to perceive and measure aspects of the dream that make

co-creative theory predicts that dreams reveal measurable 
dreamer awarenesses and responses that precipitate shifts 
in imagery which, in turn, impact the dreamer‚Äôs subsequent 
awarenesses and responses. This circular causal process 
establishes a reciprocal relationship between the dreamer 
and the imagery, from which one may discern a directional 
thrust of the encounter. 
Circular causality, or reciprocity, is a familiar concept to 
marriage and family therapists (Nichols, 2012), who custom -
arily track the interactive or circular process between family 
members in order to assist them in acknowledging their re -
spective contributions to a relational process that cannot be 
reduced conveniently to a single cause or any one person‚Äôs 
doing, but rather is supported by constant back-and-forth 
exchanges . Similarly, from the standpoint of co-creative 
dream work, the unfoldment of the dream narrative has to

ego responds in such a way as to effect a particular shift in 
the dream narrative, and needs to take responsibility for the 
impact that he or she had on the dream. Co-creative dream 
theory views the dream as a ‚Äúbranching‚Äù experience, the 
end of which may be a single narrative, but whose process entails a number of responses and commensurate imagery 
changes that could have produced altogether different out -
comes. These ‚Äúbranching‚Äù moments are characterized by 
choices or reactions on the part of the dreamer that might, 
in traditional dream analysis, go unnoticed, but within co-
creative theory comprise the centerpiece of the dream 
work. A dream worker aligned with co-creative theory will 
listen for these choice moments, and observe any commen -
surate changes in dream imagery. Thus, instead of asking 
what a dream means, or what a particular symbol means, 
the central question regarding imagery from the standpoint 
of co-creative dream analysis is, ‚ÄúHow does the imagery

does the imagery change in relation to the dream ego‚Äôs own

Dreamers will characteristically leave out themselves out 
of the dream as they relate ‚Äújust the facts‚Äù (Kasmova and

facilitator may stop the dreamer at crucial junctures during 
this initial sharing and ask the dreamer to share any feelings 
and thoughts that are emerging.
Jerry‚Äôs dream

of his classmates in my graduate group counseling class

while in the military, he had brought his pregnant Asian wife

do to protect his wife and future family: He left abruptly and 
broke off contact with his father. Years passed without any 
further contact, and his father eventually died. The student 
reported experiencing a complete absence of grief at the 
time of his father‚Äôs death. Further, he had never questioned 
his original decision to terminate his relationship with his 
father, even though they had been close prior to the breach
Before the man shared the dream in the present tense, I

Sharing
The idea of initially examining the feelings is consistent with 
Hartmann‚Äôs theory that dreams function principally to ‚Äúcon -
textualize‚Äù emotion for the purpose of its integration through 
associative neural processes (Hartmann, 1998). By hav -
ing the dreamer and the dream helpers share the feelings 
that arise when experiencing the dream narrative‚Äîa step 
that was pioneered by Ullman (Ullman, 1996; Ullman and 
;JNNFSNBO
rrUIJTJOJUJBMTUFQNBZQSPWJEFBOBGGFD -
tive context congruent with the contextualized affect of the 
dream itself.  However, the dreamer may not be able or will -
ing to experience the full range of emotion contextualized 
PSJNQMJFEJOBHJWFOESFBNrFJUIFSJOUIFPSJHJOBMFYQFSJFODF
because of psychodynamic resistance, or in a recollected 
version because of concerns about interpersonal exposure.  
Thus, as the dreamer and the dream helpers compare their 
emotional reactions to the dream narrative, they may dis -
cover differences in their feelings. This sharing often sets up 
a subtle tension in which the dreamer may be exposed to 
a variety of emotional responses that differ from his or her 
own feelings. If, as Taylor (1992)  and Delaney (1993) as -
sert, a dream rarely comes to tell us what we already know, 
then it is also makes sense that the dreamer is not always in 
touch with the full range of feelings contextualized, or pic -
tured, in the dream imagery.
Various dream work methods include an assessment of the 
dreamer‚Äôs feelings (Gendlin, 1986; Hill, 1996; Mahrer, 1990; 
Ullman, 1996; Ullman and Zimmerman, 1985). However, co-
creative dream theory posits that the dream ego‚Äôs feelings, 
UIPVHIUTBTTVNQUJPOTBOECFIBWJPSTrrUIBUJTXIBUNJHIU
CFSFGFSSFEUPBTUIFHMPCBMTVCKFDUJWFSFTQPOTFrrXPSLUP -
gether to co-create the dream‚Äôs outcome. With this in mind, 
the dreamer‚Äôs feelings provide an initial entry into the dream 
ego‚Äôs co-determining global subjective response set.  
Jerry‚Äôs dream:  I asked the dreamer about his feelings in 
the dream, and he said that he had felt anxious about his as -
signment, and mildly irritated about his father‚Äôs interruption 
throughout the dream. That was the extent of his feelings. 
I then asked each member of the group to share whatever 
feelings had arisen in the course of experiencing the dream. 
Without exception, the other students reported having in -
tense feelings such as sadness, fear, regret, and even affec -
tion. The dreamer was surprised at the range of the group 
members‚Äô reactions.
Of course, dreamers often report having little or no emo -
tion, especially when merely witnessing the dream as it 
unfolds. When hearing such emotionless dreams, a dream 
group, or an individual facilitator may or may not experience 
any feelings. If they do, then those feelings could be useful 
to the dreamer, who may for various reasons could be cut

early collaboration developing dream work methods and 
courses at the Association for the Research and Enlighten -
ment, Mark Thurston (1978; 1988) and I (Sparrow, 1978) de -
veloped a phenomenological approach similar to Gendlin‚Äôs 

A new method of dream analysis
International Journal of Dream Research   Volume 6, No. 1 (2013) 50D IJoR
(1986) approach to extracting the dream ‚Äústory‚Äù by summa -
rizing the dream‚Äôs underlying theme. Instead of continuing 
to use the term ‚Äútheme‚Äù (Sparrow, 1978; Thurston, 1978) to 
describe this dimension of the dream, I have adopted the 
phrase ‚Äúprocess narrative,‚Äù even though Gendlin‚Äôs ‚Äústory,‚Äù 
(1986) and Thurston‚Äôs ‚Äúsimple story line‚Äù (1988) represents a 
less abstract way to describe this step to client/dreamers. 
Dicicco‚Äôs Story Telling Method arguably accomplishes the 
same goal by asking the dreamer to replace the dream con -
tent with familiar images and to retell it. The Story Telling 
Method resembles what family therapists (Bowen, 1978) 
refer to as ‚Äúdisplacement stories,‚Äù in which the therapist of -
fers a story that parallels the client‚Äôs problematic narrative. 
The displacement story can be made up by the therapist, or 
taken from a popular myth, book or movie. Regardless, its 
QVSQPTFJTUPHJWFUIFDMJFOUTVG√•DJFOUEJTUBODFGSPNIJTPS
her problem and to present an alternative narrative that of -
fers a possible approach to solving it. Regardless of whether 
one replaces the dream content with waking associations, 
as Diccico‚Äôs method does, or removes it entirely as the FSM 
does, both encourage the dreamer to perceive a pattern 
that is often obscured by the literal dream imagery.
To formulate the process narrative, all one has to do is 
to restate, as succinctly as possible, the dream‚Äôs essential 
TUPSZMJOFXIJMFSFNPWJOHUIFTQFDJ√•DOBNFTPGDIBSBDUFST
colors, places, and objects. All interpretive and evaluative 
statements are strictly discouraged during this step. The 
following statements (which are unrelated to Jerry‚Äôs dream) 
are examples of correctly formulated process narratives,

volves receiving help from someone else.‚Äù  This content-
free description reveals an underlying pattern that might be 
evident in one‚Äôs waking life. By removing all of the content, 
the pattern becomes clearer to the dreamer. 
Some dream work facilitators believe that it is important 
to obtain the dreamer‚Äôs explanation of  the characters and 
situations early in the dream work process (Delaney, 1993; 
1996), so that the helper(s) may make contributions that are 
congruent with the dreamer‚Äôs own understanding of who‚Äôs 
who and what‚Äôs what in the dream. In contrast, the FSM 
postpones any consideration of the imagery, including the 
dreamer‚Äôs explanatory associations, until after the third 
step. While this may seem to encourage irrelevant associa -
tions by the facilitator(s), it frees the facilitator (and group if 
present) to associate to the dream without having to factor 
in the dreamer‚Äôs own views. The dreamer, in turn, is encour -
aged to examine the dream without regard to the imagery, 
so that any subsequent ‚Äúallusion‚Äù (Craig and Walsh, 1993) 
or ‚Äúbridge‚Äù  (Delaney, 1993; 1996) to waking experiences 
will be thoroughly informed by an exploration of the non-
visual dimensions of the dream. 
Jerry‚Äôs dream:   One of the students suggested that the 
theme of Jerry‚Äôs dream was, ‚ÄúSomeone is aware of some -
one who wants his attention, but refuses to give it because 
he considers something else more important.‚Äù  Jerry and 
the other group members concurred with this assessment, 
and we moved to the next step.Step Three: Dreamer Response Analysis
Dreamer Response Analysis and Imagery Change Analysis 
(Sparrow, 2012) comprise steps three and four of the FSM, 
and are pure outgrowths of co-creative dream theory. Help -
ing the dreamer see the places where his or her responses 
may have made a positive or negative difference represents 
a departure from content-focused dream analysis. Because 
of its novelty, it may pose somewhat of a challenge to clients 
who are new to this way of thinking. But once the dreamer 
becomes aware of his or her responses in the dream, dream 
analysis takes on a new dimension of troubleshooting the 
dream ego‚Äôs responses and imagining new outcomes in fu -
ture dreams and parallel life situations.
To accomplish this step, the facilitator and the dreamer 
look for points in the dream where the dreaming self re -
sponded‚Äîemotionally, cognitively, and/or behaviorally‚Äîin 
such ways that could have affected the course of the dream 
from thereon. As we have stated, some of these responses 
may be entirely unstated in the dreamer‚Äôs initial recollection, 
so it may take some practice to elicit the more subtle dimen -
sions of the dream ego‚Äôs responses. Subtle or otherwise, 
these response points are like forks in the path where the 
dreamer effectively determines which way to go by his or 
her reactions to the visual imagery. 
Then, the facilitator(s) and dreamer work together to cri -
tique the dreaming self‚Äôs responses to the dream encoun -
ters. One dimension of Dreamer Response Analysis is to 
increase the dreamer‚Äôs awareness of chronic responses 
that may have shifted the dream in an unfortunate direc -
tion. However, in the spirit of Solution-Focused Brief Ther -
apy (de Schazer, 1988; de Schazer, et. al, 2007), the goal is 
also to highlight creative and adaptive responses, and to 
reframe such responses as ‚Äúexceptional moments‚Äù that the 
dreamer may have dismissed as ordinary. After highlighting 
both positive and unfortunate responses, the facilitator(s) 
engages the dreamer in determining what he or she would 
like to do more of, or differently, in future dreams with similar 
situations. This consideration of diverse responses to the 
dream has a way of questioning chronic relational patterns, 
discerning emerging competencies, and introducing alter -
natives for future consideration. 
Of course, the dreamer ideally sets the standard for the 
direction of desirable change. What is considered ‚Äúbetter‚Äù 
has more to do with what deviates constructively from a 
person‚Äôs chronic patterns of relating, and what is congruent 
with the dreamer‚Äôs own beliefs, morals and values, rather 
than some external standard of relational health. This client-
centered criterion helps the facilitator(s) and dreamer evalu -
ate the dream ego‚Äôs responses against a customary or ha -
bitual style of relating, which may become clearer over time 
as the person shares further dreams and/or waking experi -
ences in which the customary style becomes evident. This 
orientation to desirable change, developed as the client and 
therapist explore the client‚Äôs own value set, is a negotiated 
standard of evaluation, not an imposed one. In the words of 
Wolfe (1989),

situations. However, as repetitive patterns become increas -
ingly evident in successive dreams and waking life experi -
ences, as well, such responses can be gently challenged if 
they are inconsistent with the dreamer‚Äôs own stated morals 
and values.
Jerry‚Äôs dream:  When we considered the dream ego‚Äôs re -
sponses alongside the group‚Äôs vicarious responses, Jerry 
was again struck by the contrast between what he did, and 
what the dream group members had imagined him doing. 
One member imagined opening the door to let his father in. 
"OPUIFSNFNCFSXBTBMJUUMFBGSBJErBGUFSBMMUIFNBOXBT
EFBErBOEXBOUFEUPBTLUIFGBUIFSXIBUIFXBOUFECFGPSF
opening the door. Another imagined hugging his dad and 
hearing his father‚Äôs sincere and tearful apologies as well as 
expressing his own remorse. Unlike Jerry‚Äôs cool, business-
like attitude, the group members‚Äô responses were generally 
intense and engaging. Since the group members had come 
to know each other over a period of several weeks of small 
group work and during classroom interactions, they were 
cognizant of many of Jerry‚Äôs relational strengths and limita -
tions. Through such exposure to a dreamer‚Äôs waking per -
sonality, what is customarily regarded as mere ‚Äúprojection‚Äù 
in group dream work gradually becomes, to some extent, 
an ‚Äúinformed‚Äù projection more closely tied to the dreamer‚Äôs 
somewhat unique ways of relating.
Dream Response Analysis helps dreamers become more 
aware of chronic dysfunctional responses and emergent 
competencies, both of which are easily overlooked in the 
context of the often-distressing circumstances depicted by 
the dream content. To put it simply, the interpersonal ex -
change between the facilitator(s) and client in Step Three 
helps to offset the tendency of some dreamers to disavow 
responsibility for the outcome of the dream.  While this step 
can provoke defensiveness by raising questions about the 
dreamer‚Äôs unexamined assumptions and reactions, espe -
cially when the dreamer‚Äôs responses seem counterproduc -
tive, it represents the kind of cognitive-behavioral inquiry

Therapy, and Reality Therapy. Further, by highlighting emer -
gent competencies, Step Three comes into alignment with 
the philosophy and objectives of competency-based thera -
pies such as Solution-Focused Brief Therapy (de Schazer, 
1988; de Schazer, et. al, 2007). In this regard, Jerry‚Äôs abil -
ity to remain committed to his task at hand was clearly, on 
one hand, a positive quality that had helped him excel as a

ing exchange between a group and the dreamer can, in my 
experience, far outweigh the costs.
Step Four: Imagery Change Analysis
In this step in the dream work, the facilitator assists the 
dreamer in exploring the imagery itself. While I often intro -
duce standard nonintrusive approaches to imagery analy -

Four, a nontraditional approach to the imagery that I have 
termed Imagery Change Analysis (Sparrow, 2012) naturally 
proceeds from a co-creative approach to dream analysis. 
Just as the dream ego‚Äôs responses are no longer consid -
ered a given in co-creative dream theory, the dreaming self‚Äôs 
responses and the dream imagery are viewed as recipro -
cally related, such that a change in one will usually evoke 
or mirror a change in the other, much in the way that ‚Äúreal‚Äù 
relationships evolve in the waking state. 
Just as systems-oriented therapists consider reciproc -
ity to be the ‚Äúgoverning principle in relationships‚Äù (Nichols 
and Schwartz, 2004, p. 8), and will coach their clients to

work facilitator using the Five Star Method will encourage 
the dreamer to learn to see the impact of his or her reac -
tions on the dream imagery itself, and to extrapolate on 
possible changes that may have occurred if the responses 
would have been different. Even if the dream ego and the 
dream imagery are ‚Äúlocked‚Äù into a relationship of escalat -

what could have happened if the dream ego‚Äôs stance had 
been different.  At this stage in the dream work, the facilita -
tor also asks the dreamer to imagine what the culmination 
PGTVDIBOFODPVOUFSXPVMEMPPLMJLFrrJOGVUVSFESFBNTPS
parallel waking scenarios. Such a consideration, which is 
familiar to narrative therapists, leads naturally to the idea of 
identifying contexts in which to apply the fruits of the dream 
work process.

tains a circular relationship with the dream ego‚Äôs responses, 
questions such as ‚ÄúWhat does this symbol mean?‚Äù have 
limited value by rendering the dreamer‚Äôs involvement irrel -
evant. Instead, the dreamer learns to ask alternative ques -
tions such as, ‚ÄúHow is my response affecting my relation -
ship with the dream image?‚Äù Such questions respect the 
complexity of a dynamic reciprocal process which, if hon -
ored and kept alive, may foster a rich interchange between 
conscious perspectives and unrealized potentials. Process 
questions (Bowen, 1978), such as ‚ÄúWhat do you think would 
have happened if . . . ?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat do you wish you could 
have done differently?‚Äù are very useful in this step. Such 
inquiry encourages clients to become aware of the circular 
or reciprocal nature of a relationship dynamic, and to accept 
one‚Äôs capacity to assume personal responsibility and make 
a difference in the dreamer-dream relationship, and in obvi -
ous waking life parallels. 
Jerry‚Äôs dream:  In considering the dream imagery, the 
dream helpers were all impressed with his father‚Äôs suit. Ev -
eryone felt that his father had ‚Äúdressed for the occasion,‚Äù 
or was ‚Äúhoping to make a good impression.‚Äù One member

suggested that it reminded him of burial clothes. The slid -
ing glass doors provided an opening through which things 
could be clearly seen, and people were allowed to come 
and go, but this openness was behind the dreamer and 
ignored, not something he was facing directly. The paper 
that the student was working on was one of many tasks 
JOIJTMJGFrBMXBZTVOEFSUBLFOXJUITFSJPVTBOEVOEJTUSBDUFE
resolve. The student contributed to and supported these 
various associations.
We also engaged the dreamer in considering what would 
have happened to the imagery if he had gone to the door 
and engaged his father. Since it was clear that Jerry had 
considerable resistance to this idea, we focused on what he 
DPVMEIBWFTBJEUPIJTGBUIFSUIBUXPVMEIBWF√•OBMMZHJWFO
voice to his anger and hurt. By focusing on how he could 
have expressed his deep anger, the group effectively ac -
cepted Jerry where he was at, without precluding the pos -
sibility of forgiveness and healing.
Step Five: Applying the Dream Work
Since the FSM is founded on the dream self‚Äôs capacity

the FSM involves identifying contexts in one‚Äôs waking life 
where the dream ego‚Äôs responses may serve as a model 
for enacting new responses, or might represent problem -
atic responses that call for new approaches. If the dreamer 
can identify parallels between the dream scenario and some 
waking situation, then the facilitator may encourage the 
dreamer to practice new, contextually appropriate respons -
es that can be made in that waking life scenario. Underlying

principle that in living systems, a particular end state can 
be achieved through a variety of ways. So, from this stand -
point, it does not matter which context in which the dreamer 
enacts new responses. Applying the dream work, therefore, 
can also take the form of preparing for future dreams by 
imagining new responses in future dreams that might free 
the dreamer from an arrested dream exchange, and achieve 
a more desirable end. Similar to Imagery Change Analysis, 
this approach is called Dream Reliving, and has been used

Jerry‚Äôs dream:  While the dreamer was sobered by the 
group process, the group did nothing that could have been 
construed as invasive. Remaining true to their own feel -
ings, imaginary responses, associations with the imagery, 
and imagined changed in the imagery, the group members 
nonetheless left the dreamer wondering out loud if his deci -
sion to walk away from his father had established an overall 
non-negotiating stance toward a variety of circumstances in 
his life. While he ended the dream work unwilling to recon -
sider his unyielding stance toward his father, he was able to 
see that he had developed a tendency to ‚Äúwalk away with -
out looking back‚Äù in many areas of his life where a more 
compromising attitude would have been appropriate. Taking 
steps to resolve his ‚Äúemotional cutoff‚Äù (Bowen, 1978) in oth -
er relationships could, in time, inspire Jerry to acknowledge 
his need to revisit his relationship with his deceased father,

3. Conclusions
Research indicates that dream work accelerates and deep -
ens the psychotherapeutic process. However, an exclusive 
content-focused approach to dream analysis departs from 
the objectives of most non-psychodynamic therapy by treat -

for its presumed meaning. Add to that the object-oriented 
language that characterizes the traditional consideration of 
dream ‚Äúsymbols‚Äù and ‚Äúcontent‚Äù apart from the dreamer, 
and dream interpretation arguably violates the social con -

contemporary psychotherapy. 
Unlike traditional content-oriented approaches, a co-
creative or co-determined approach to dream theory and 
analysis comes into alignment with a variety of themes in 
contemporary psychotherapy, including the centrality of 
choice, freedom, and personal responsibility in existential 
therapies; the constructed nature of personal reality in so -
cial constructionism and postmodern therapies; and the 
reciprocal nature of human relationships in family systems.  
As such, co-creative dream work methods can be seen as 
a supportive, supplementary practice in a diverse array of 
modern therapies, and thus be incorporated seamlessly into 
contemporary counselor training.
