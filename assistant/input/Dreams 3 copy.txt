Dream
Interpretation
People
have
been
fascinated
with
the
interpretation
of
dreams
since
ancient
times,
when
they
were
thought
to
contain
religious
or
spiritual
messages.
Some
people
and
cultures
maintain
that
perspective,
but
since
then,
countless
other
theories
about
what
dreams
mean
have
been
proposed
and
investigated.
Today ,
there
are
hundreds
of
books
available
on
how
to
interpret
dreams.
Many
mental
health
professionals
still
use
dream
analysis
in
their
practices.
However ,
scientists
still
do
not
know
the
precise
purpose
dreaming
serves.
Although
researchers
haven’t
found
a
definitive
answer
about
what
our
dreams
mean,
it
can
be
fascinating
to
dive
into
current
and
historic
ideas
about
dreaming
and
learn
about
the
varied
explanations
that
have
been
explored
over
the
years.
Theories
on
Why
We
Dream
Experts
are
not
sure
why
people
dream.
Throughout
history ,
many
scientists,
psychologists,
and
anthropologists
have
come
up
with
theories.
 
Emotional
processing:
Some
believe
dreams
help
us
process
strong
emotions.
People
who
are
stressed
are
more
likely
to
have
upsetting
dreams.
In
addition,
people
often
have
recurring
dreams
about
themes
or
situations
that
they
are
intensely
concerned
about.
 
Memory
formation:
Parts
of
the
brain
that
are
in
charge
of
memorization
are
active
during
sleep,
suggesting
that
dreaming
may
play
a
role
in
memory
and
learning.
Studies
have
shown
that
dream
scenarios
include
fragments
of
memories,
especially
recently-learned
information.
 
Generalization
and
cognitive
performance:
The
overfitted
brain
hypothesis
proposes
that
dreams
are
random
and
strange
in
contrast
to

the
repetitiveness
of
daily
life.
This
contrast
helps
us
to
maintain
a
big-picture
perspective
and
avoid
information
overload.
 
No
purpose:
Some
researchers
believe
that
dreams
do
not
serve
any
particular
mental
or
physical
purpose.
Instead,
they
suggest
that
different
societies
have
developed
uses
for
dreams
throughout
history .
For
example,
some
cultures
rely
on
dreams
to
predict
important
events.
Carl
Jung
and
Sigmund
Freud
were
two
pioneering
psychologists
who
studied
the
meaning
and
purpose
of
dreams.
Each
developed
his
own
theories
of
why
people
dream
and
how
dreams
should
be
interpreted.
Freud’s
Unconscious
Mind
Theory
Freud
believed
that
individuals
dream
as
a
form
of
wish
fulfillment.
He
theorized
that
people
repress
many
uncomfortable
desires
and
thoughts.
Repressed
ideas
form
what
Freud
called
the
unconscious,
or
a
part
of
the
mind
that
we
are
not
aware
of
during
waking
life.
According
to
Freud,
these
repressed
ideas
reappear
throughout
in
symbolic
form
through
jokes,
slip-ups
while
speaking,
and
dreams.
Jung’s
Archetypes
Theory
Jung
incorporated
some
of
Freud’ s
ideas
into
his
own
practices.
However ,
Jung
contributed
his
own
dream
interpretation
theory
centered
on
the
concept
of
compensation.
He
believed
that
dreams
allow
people
to
“compensate,”
or
explore
complex
symbols
hidden
in
the
unconscious
called
archetypes.
The
archetypes
that
appear
in
dreams
indicate
parts
of
an
individual’ s
personality
that
are
out
of
balance
or
underdeveloped.
The
Possible
Meanings
Behind
Common
Dreams
Some
researchers
believe
that
dreams
include
imagery
from
the
individual’ s
waking
thoughts,
fears,
and
memories
but
do
not
contain
symbols
that
convey
a
deeper ,
hidden
meaning.

There
is
no
strong
evidence
to
indicate
that
dreams
contain
more
symbolism
than
other
types
of
thought.
Despite
this,
some
mental
health
practitioners
use
dream
analysis
to
learn
more
about
their
clients.
This
is
because
dreams
may
highlight
memories
and
issues
that
are
important
to
a
person.
If
you
are
interested
in
interpreting
your
dreams,
it
may
help
to
focus
on
your
own
personal
feelings
toward
the
subjects
and
images
you
perceive
while
dreaming.
Your
associations
with
people,
places,
and
things
are
uniquely
yours.
For
this
reason,
broad
dream
interpretations
may
not
resonate
or
feel
accurate
to
you.
However ,
some
themes
do
seem
to
appear
repeatedly
in
many
people’ s
dreams,
and
there
is
no
shortage
of
ideas
about
what
those
common
themes
may
signify .
Your
Teeth
Are
Falling
Out
Dreams
about
losing
teeth
are
so
common
that
some
researchers
believe
they
are
almost
universal.
From
Ancient
Greece
to
the
Talmud
and
Freud’ s
writings
in
the
20th
century ,
people
have
tried
interpreting
dreams
about
losing
their
teeth.
Experts
remain
mystified
about
why
so
many
people
dream
about
their
teeth
rotting
or
falling
out.
A
leading
theory
about
dreaming
is
that
they
reflect
events
in
our
waking
lives.
However ,
this
doesn’t
widely
apply
to
dreams
about
losing
teeth
because
most
individuals
do
not
experience
tooth
loss
on
a
regular
basis.
Some
claim
that
dreams
about
losing
teeth
are
related
to
stress
and
emotional
upset.
Others
suggest
that
these
dreams
may
be
related
to
dental
pain
or
mouth
irritation
instead
of
psychological
distress.
Flying
or
Falling
Studies
indicate
that
more
than
half
of
people
dream
about
flying
or
falling.

Flying
can
be
a
pleasant
dream
experience
and
is
one
sought
by
many
lucid
dreamers
.
A
lucid
dream
involves
being
aware
you
are
dreaming
and,
in
some
cases,
attempting
to
control
the
dream
narrative.
Dreams
of
falling
frequently
occur
before
experiencing
a
hypnic
jerk.
Hypnic
jerks
are
sharp,
sudden
flinches
of
the
body
that
occur
as
a
person
falls
asleep.
Hypnic
jerks
are
normal
and
are
not
a
cause
for
concern.
They
are
more
likely
to
happen
when
you
are
sleep
deprived,
or
if
you
have
recently
used
stimulants
like
caffeine.
Insects
or
Spiders
Dreams
about
insects
have
been
interpreted
very
differently
among
cultures
and
time
periods.
An
ancient
Greek
dream
interpretation
manual
from
the
2nd
century
A.D.
states
that
insects
symbolize
worries.
Some
modern
psychotherapists
suggest
that
children
dreaming
about
bugs
represents
a
feeling
of
being
small
and
powerless.
People
with
sleep
disorders
like
sleepwalking
or
night
terrors
sometimes
have
vivid
dreams
that
involve
insects
or
spiders.
They
may
see
or
feel
insects
crawling
on
them
or
in
their
surroundings.
Being
Chased
Nightmares
,
including
dreams
about
being
chased,
are
common.
People
may
be
more
likely
to
dream
about
being
chased
or
other
frightening
scenarios
during
periods
of
stress,
after
traumatic
events,
or
due
to
anxiety
.
Some
mental
health
conditions
and
medications
can
also
cause
nightmares.
If
you
are
concerned
that
your
medication
may
be
contributing
to
dreams
about
being
chased
or
other
frightening
scenarios,
talk
with
your
doctor
before
making
any
adjustments
to
your
treatment
plan.
Having
An
Affair
Aspects
of
your
romantic
life
may
affect
the
subjects
of
your
dreams.
Some
studies
have
shown
that
dreams
about
infidelity
are
linked
to
having
been
cheated
on
in
a
relationship.
Dreaming
that
you
are
having
an
affair
might
be
associated
with
jealousy
or
low
intimacy
in
your
current
relationship.

Seeing
a
Deceased
Friend
or
Relative
Researchers
believe
that
dreaming
of
deceased
individuals
may
help
loved
ones
cope
with
grief
and
adjust
to
their
loss.
These
dreams
allow
people
to
maintain
a
sort
of
bond
with
the
individual
who
has
died
as
they
process
emotions
related
to
their
loss.
How
to
Analyze
and
Interpret
Dreams
Evidence
suggests
that
dream
imagery
is
related
to
each
individual’ s
personal
experiences,
and
there
is
no
scientific
guide
that
can
tell
you
how
to
interpret
dreams.
However ,
there
are
some
steps
you
can
take
to
understand
your
own
dreams—and
possibly
yourself—a
bit
better .
 
Focus
on
your
own
feelings:
Instead
of
searching
for
a
broad
explanation,
consider
your
own
associations
with
the
content
and
themes
that
appear
in
your
dreams.
A
dream
about
snakes
might
be
frightening
to
some
people,
for
example,
while
others
may
find
it
fascinating.
 
Write
it
down:
It
is
easy
to
forget
the
details
of
a
dream
within
minutes
of
waking
up.
Keep
a
notebook
next
to
your
bed
so
you
can
write
down
your
dreams
as
soon
as
possible,
or
try
using
a
smartphone
app
to
take
notes.
 
Talk
to
a
professional:
Contact
a
doctor
if
you
are
having
nightmares
so
frequently
that
they
impact
your
sleep
habits
or
daytime
mood.
A
professional
can
also
help
you
work
through
issues
such
as
trauma
or
grief
that
may
affect
your
dreams.
Finally ,
let
your
doctor
know
if
you
believe
a
medication
or
medication
withdrawal
is
giving
you
nightmares.
