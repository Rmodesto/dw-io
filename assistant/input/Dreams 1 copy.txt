Interpretation
Of
Dreams
(Analytical
Psychology)
INTERPRETATION
OF
DREAMS
(ANALYTICAL
PSYCHOLOGY)
Jung
considered
the
dream
a
natural
and
normal
psychic
phenomenon
describing
the
inner
situation
of
the
dreamer ,
a
"spontaneous
self-portrayal
in
symbolical
form
of
the
actual
situation
in
the
unconscious"
(Jung,
1947).
In
analytical
psychology
the
dream
is
seen
as
neither
a
disguise
nor
a
symptom
but
as
a
source
of
new
understanding,
especially
of
the
psychic
function
of
archetypal
imagery .
Jung
never
distinguished
between
manifest
and
latent
meaning,
since
he
based
his
understanding
directly
on
dream
content.
Analytical
psychology
does
not
generally
encourage
free
association
per
se;
rather ,
it
employs
circular
associations
around
the
various
images
and
actions
in
the
dream
to
make
sense
of
the
dream
in
its
entirety .
In
analytical
psychology ,
the
concepts
of
sign
and
symbol
have
meanings
different
from
their
meanings
in
psychoanalytic
usage.
For
Jung,
a
sign
is
a
token
of
meaning
that
stands
for
something
known,
whereas
a
symbol
is
an
image
that
points
to
something
partially
known
but
unknowable
at
its
core.
A
symbol
has
a
subjective
dynamic
that
powerfully
attracts
the
individual
and
transforms
psychological
energy .
Jung
first
read
Freud's
Interpretation
of
Dreams
in
1900
as
a
student
at
the
Burgholzi
Psychiatric
Clinic
in
Zurich,
reviewing
it

for
his
fellow
psychiatric
students
(Jung,
1907).
He
began
to
develop
his
own
ideas
about
the
meaning
of
dreams
shortly
after
his
break
with
Freud
around
1912
to
1913,
and
by
1928
he
had
outlined
his
mature
views.
Dreams
can
be
interpreted
on
three
levels:
objective,
subjective,
and
transferential.
Any
interpretation
that
refers
the
images
in
the
dream
to
the
subject's
view
of
external
objects
is
considered
an
interpretation
on
the
objective
level.
Any
interpretation
that
refers
every
part
of
the
dream
back
to
the
dreamer
is
an
interpretation
on
the
subjective
level.
Interpretation
on
the
objective
level
breaks
the
dream
content
down
into
memory
traces
referring
to
the
external
situation.
Interpretation
on
the
subjective
level
detaches
the
underlying
memories
from
their
external
sources
and
presents
the
dreamer
with
the
images
as
inner
facts.
Such
experience
of
inner
reality
opens
the
way
for
psychological
transformation.
Transferential
interpretation
is
a
mixture
of
the
two
levels,
except
that
dream
images
are
interpreted
in
relationship
to
the
transference.
Dreams
compensate
for
attitudes
held
consciously .
This
follows
from
the
concept
of
the
psyche
as
a
self-regulating
system,
dreams
representing
an
unconscious
voice.
Jung
saw
compensation
as
operating
in
two
directions.
One
he
termed
the
"prospective
function,"
by
which
he
meant
that
the
dream
is
an
anticipation
of
future
conscious
achievement.
This
does
not
mean
that
dreams
are
prophetic;
rather ,
a
dream
is
a
preliminary
exercise,
a
combination
of
possibilities,
roughly
sketched
out
in
advance.
In
their
prospective
function,
dreams
can
be
both
integrative
and
synthetic.
In
the
other
direction,
the

reductive
function,
the
dream
operates
as
a
retrospective
compensation,
bringing
up
repressed
material.
A
dream
can
be
interpreted
in
either
or
both
directions
at
the
same
or
different
times
and
at
different
developmental
stages.
No
interpretation
is
considered
final.
Another
important,
uniquely
Jungian
method
in
dream
interpretation
is
amplification.
Here
analogous
material
is
brought
into
play
to
enlarge
upon
the
symbols
of
the
dream.
Parallels
from
mythology ,
folklore,
anthropology ,
comparative
religion,
ethology ,
and
current
cultural
patterns
are
presented
to
the
analysis
to
elicit
a
richer
understanding
of
the
dream.
Amplification
is
used
less
often
today ,
as
analytical
psychologists
have
become
more
aware
that
it
can
be
used
to
avoid
personal
issues.
Basically ,
analytical
psychology
teaches
an
open
attitude
in
interpreting
dreams.
Jung
stressed
that
each
dream
should
be
approached
without
preconceived
notions.
At
the
beginning
of
the
twenty-first
century
there
is
a
greater
emphasis
on
transferential
interpretations
in
analytical
psychology .
Yet
many
analytical
psychologists
hold
the
view
that
dream
images
are
part
of
the
objective
reality
of
the
psyche
and
that
dream
interpretation
is
central
to
theory
and
practice.
