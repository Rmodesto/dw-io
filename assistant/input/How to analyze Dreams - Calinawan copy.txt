How
to
Analyze
a
Dream
Using
Jungian 
Dream
Analysis
2021
Jonah
Calinawan
Last
weekend,
I
had
a
dream
that
mystified
me
so
much
that
I
had
to
analyze
it.
This
article
describes
a
step-by-step
process
in
dream
interpretation
based
on
Carl
Jung’s
work.
If
you’ve
ever
wanted
to
understand
your
dreams,
I
recommend
a
good
book
to
get
you
started.
But
first,
I
want
to
tell
you
about
the
dream.
The
Dream
I’m
at
work
in
an
open-concept
office
where
cubicles
are
in
an
assembly
line
formation.
Each
cubicle
shares
a
middle
partition
with
a
mirror-cubicle
on
the
other
side.
In
this
dream,
I’m
sitting
on
one
side,
while
my
co-worker
Phillip
is
sitting
opposite
me
on
the
other
side.
“Hey
Jonah,
do
you
want
to
sit
beside
me,
or
do
you
want
to
stay
where
you
are
on
your
side?”
Phillip
asks.
As
I’m
debating
the
pros/cons
of
where
I
should
sit,
Reid,
my
boss,
comes
over
and
says,
“Jonah,
can
I
see
you
in
my
office?”
So,
I
walk
into
his
office,
and
I
see
a
leather
club
chair.
As
I
walk
closer,
I
realize
that
the
chair
is
teeming
with
ants
and
some
sticky
substance
like
honey
or
tree
sap.
I
couldn’t
tell
which.
“How
am
I
going
to
sit
on
that?
I
would
have
to
clean
that
off
first.”
I
said
to
myself.
Then,
I
woke
up.
I
usually
don’t
remember
my
dreams,
but
this
one
was
so
vivid
that
I
excitedly
recounted
it
to
my
partner
that
Sunday
morning.
Later
in
the
day,
we
walked
around
the
Baltimore
Inner
Harbor,
stopped
at
the
newly
opened
Whole
Foods
at
Harbor
East,
and
decided
to
sit
by
the

water
for
a
bit.
Picking
a
spot,
I
sat
down
on
a
wood
bench.
I
looked
down
and
couldn’t
believe
my
eyes.
Ants.
I
saw
the
ants
from
my
dream.
Where
Do
Dreams
Come
From?
In
my
research
for
this
article,
I
was
surprised
that
even
in
the
21st
century,
the
“why”
and
“how”
of
dreams
are
largely
undeveloped
from
the
time
of
Sigmund
Freud
and
Carl
Jung.
Of
the
two,
I
was
attracted
to
Carl
Jung’s
theory.
He
considered
dreams
to
be
messages
from
the
unconscious:
“Dreams
are
impartial,
spontaneous
products
of
the
unconscious
psyche,
outside
the
control
of
the
will.
They
are
pure
nature;
they
show
us
the
unvarnished,
natural
truth,
and
are
therefore
fitted,
as
nothing
else
is,
to
give
us
back
an
attitude
that
accords
with
our
basic
human
nature
when
our
consciousness
has
strayed
too
far
from
its
foundations
and
run
into
an
impasse.”
Carl
Jung,
CW
10:317
This
is
an
exciting
finding
as
I’m
already
curious
about
synchronicity
and
mythology.
Now
I
can
add
dreams
and
the
unconscious
to
the
mix
of
mysteries.
If
dreams
are
messages
from
the
unconscious,
then
what
was
my
unconscious
trying
to
say?
A
Warning
about
Dream
Analysis
But
before
we
begin,
a
word
of
caution.
Dream
analysis
engages
the
unconscious,
and
it
might
bring
up
contents
you
don’t
want
to
face.
It’s
not
a
game.
Here’s
what
Jung
had
to
say
about
it:
We
are
greatly
mistaken
if
we
think
that
the
unconscious
is
something
harmless
that
could
be
made
into
an
object
of
entertainment,
a
parlour
game.
Certainly
the
unconscious
is
not
always
and
in
all
circumstances
dangerous,
but
as
soon
as
a
neurosis
is
present
it
is
a
sign
of
a
special
heaping
up
of
energy
in
the
unconscious,
like
a
charge
that
may
explode.
Here
caution
is
indicated.
One
never
knows
what
one
may
be
releasing
when
one
begins
to
analyse
dreams.
Something
deeply
buried
and
invisible
may
thereby
be
set
in
motion,
very
probably
something
that
would
have
come
to
light
sooner
or
later
anyway—but
again,
it
might
not.
It
is
as
if
one
were
digging
an
artesian
well
and
ran
the
risk
of
stumbling

on
a
volcano.
When
neurotic
symptoms
are
present
one
must
proceed
very
carefully.
Carl
Jung,
CW
7:192
In
other
words,
please
be
careful.
Stop
if
you
sense
that
something
is
wrong.
And
if
you
are
still
interested
in
exploring
dream
interpretation,
why
not
see
a
Jungian
analyst
in
your
area?
That
would
be
a
good
idea.
Step-by-Step
Process
for
Interpreting
Dreams
The
steps
below
are
from
a
Jungian
psychotherapist,
Robert
Johnson,
who
wrote
Inner
Work:
Using
Dreams
and
Active
Imagination
for
Personal
Growth
(affiliate
link).
I
read
this
book
four
years
ago
but
had
no
interest
in
writing
about
it
until
now.
1.
Write
the
Dream
in
Detail
2.
Make
Associations
3.
Connect
Dream
Images
to
What’s
Happening
Internally
4.
Interpret
the
Dream
5.
Do
a
Ritual
to
Make
the
Dream
Concrete
Step
1
Write
the
Dream
in
Detail
Write
your
dream
immediately
after
waking
up.
Otherwise,
you
will
forget.
In
the
article
Follow
Your
Bliss
,
I
recommend
keeping
a
journal.
Dreams
would
be
a
great
addition
to
that
journal.
Write
down
all
the
dream
details
even
if
they
appear
unimportant:
setting,
people,
objects,
dialogue,
smells,
sounds,
color,
and
your
“internal
talk”
and
emotions
while
dreaming
the
dream.
Step
2
Make
Associations
The
next
step
is
to
make
associations.
Think
of
the
dream
image
and
then
write
down
everything
that
comes
to
mind.
For
example,
in
my
dream,
the
“work
setting”
symbolized
drudgery,
stress,
and
competition.
Do
this
for
every
dream
detail
you
wrote
down
in
your
journal.
Don’t
consult
a
dream
dictionary.
Dream
symbols
are
unique
to
you,
so
there
is
no
sense
in
asking
other
people
or
reading
about
it.
The
only
exception
is
if
the
dream
contains
archetypal
motifs
common
to
the
human
race.
These
would
include
characters
like
father,

mother,
child,
wise
old
man,
hero,
maiden,
or
trickster.
With
archetypes,
it
doesn’t
matter
whether
you
are
white,
black,
or
brown.
We
come
from
the
same
ground
and
live
and
die
under
the
same
blue
sky
,
so
the
meaning
of
archetypes
will
be
the
same.
Step
3
Connect
Dream
Images
to
What’s
Happening
Internally
Just
like
when
reading
mythology,
dreams
are
not
meant
to
be
interpreted
literally.
The
language
of
dreams
and
the
unconscious
is
the
symbolic
image.
Therefore,
the
unconscious
borrows
images
from
your
external
environment
to
symbolize
things
in
the
dream.
For
example,
in
my
dream,
the
characters
Phillip
and
Reid
do
not
actually
refer
to
the
real
counterparts.
Each
character
represents
something
else.
Thus,
dreams
are
usually
about
the
interior
world
rather
than
the
external
one.
Step
4
Interpret
the
Dream
Taking
all
the
things
you
wrote
before,
interpret
the
dream.
Remember
that
a
dream
is
a
coherent
message
from
the
unconscious
cloaked
in
symbolism.
When
you
interpret
the
dream
and
arrive
at
an
interpretation
that
“clicks”
or
makes
you
say
“a-ha,”
then
you’re
on
the
right
path.
A
couple
of
caveats:
●
Your
unconscious
will
not
send
you
a
message
that
you
already
know
or
are
conscious
of.
Thus
the
dream’s
message
should
be
a
surprise
to
you.
●
If
you
arrive
at
a
dream
interpretation
that
is
self-congratulatory
and
self-inflating,
then
that
interpretation
is
probably
incorrect.
●
If
you
arrive
at
an
interpretation
that
blames
others,
then
that
interpretation
is
also
incorrect.
Dreams
are
about
you
and
not
others.
Remember
that
all
the
characters
in
your
dream
represent
aspects
of
yourself,
even
if
they
look
like
somebody
you
know.
Step
5
Do
a
Ritual
to
Make
the
Dream
Concrete
After
interpreting
the
dream,
honor
it
by
doing
something
physical
(and
not
just
thinking
about
it).
By
doing
something
physical,
you
integrate
the
dream,
which
was
unconscious,
into
your
conscious
waking
life.
The
ritual
is
a
way
to
send
the
message
to
your
unconscious
that
you
heard
it.
Write
in
your
journal,
pray,
light
a
candle,
or
make
art
out
of
it.
The
physical
act
should
not
be
loud
or
expensive.
The
smaller
and
the
more
intimate,
the
better.
My
Dream
Interpretation
Now,
I’m
going
to
apply
these
steps
to
my
dream.
I
cover
a
number
of
symbols
from
my
dream:
the
work
setting,
the
mirror-cubicle
setup,
my
co-worker
Phillip,
my
boss
Reid,
the

leather
club
chair,
the
ants,
and
honey/tree
sap.
This
is
a
work
in
progress,
so
the
final
interpretation
may
change
the
more
I
think
about
the
dream
in
the
coming
days.
The
Symbol
of
Work
Setting
The
work
setting
confused
me
for
a
long
time.
I
associated
it
with
my
accounting
job,
but
I
quit
that
last
October
to
be
a
full-time
artist.
So,
why
did
this
dream
show
that
I
was
back
at
my
accounting
job?
That
didn’t
make
any
sense
to
me.
Then
it
hit
me:
the
work
setting
was
a
symbol.
My
unconscious
borrowed
the
image
of
my
former
accounting
job
to
symbolize
my
current
job
as
an
artist.
Once
I
realized
what
the
work
setting
meant,
some
of
the
other
associations
fell
into
place.
The
Symbol
of
Mirror-Cubicle
Setup
I
wrote
down
many
associations
for
the
mirror-cubicle
setup
but
none
clicked,
so
I
set
it
aside
and
focused
on
my
co-worker
Phillip.
The
Symbol
of
Phillip
What
did
Phillip
represent?
After
going
over
many
associations,
the
following
clicked.
Phillip
is
a
real
person,
and
a
long
time
ago
as
part
of
a
get-to-know
session
at
a
company
retreat,
he
shared
with
everyone
that
he
was
related
to
Sir
Arthur
Conan
Doyle,
the
writer
of
Sherlock
Holmes
.
Suddenly,
the
mirror-cubicle
setup
made
sense!
Phillip
represented
the
writer
side
of
my
psyche.
Phillip
sat
directly
opposite
me.
What
the
dream
was
really
asking
was,
“Hey
Jonah,
do
you
want
to
be
a
writer,
or
do
you
want
to
stay
where
you
are
on
your
side?”
The
Symbol
of
Reid
This
“writer”
interpretation
solidified
when
I
considered
Reid.
Reid
is
also
a
very
real
person,
but
not
my
real
boss.
Reid
Callanan
is
the
director
of
the
Santa
Fe
Photographic
Workshops.
I’ve
never
met
Reid,
and
yet
here
he
was
in
my
dream
personifying
photography.
The
Symbol
of
the
Leather
Club
Chair
I
associate
the
leather
club
chair
with
comfort,
luxury,
wealth,
or
a
man-cave.
The
association
that
resonated
the
most
was
luxury.
That
luxurious
leather
chair
invited
me
to
sink
into
and
be
enveloped
by
it.
It
occurred
to
me
that
it
was
like
the
snake
that
appears
in
many
mythologies
around
the
world.
The
leather
club
chair
was
a
trickster
or
troublemaker.

This
is
the
only
dream
detail
that
feels
archetypal.
Is
this
the
definitive
interpretation?
I’m
not
feeling
a
click
or
an
a-ha
yet,
but
it
feels
very
close.
The
Symbol
of
the
Ants
I
tried
many
associations
for
the
ants
and
honey/tree
sap,
separately
and
together.
I
was
stumped
on
this
one.
I
took
a
break
and
walked
outside.
I
think
I
was
afraid
of
what
I
might
discover
if
I
continued
interpreting
the
dream.
I
wanted
the
dream
to
have
a
positive
outcome,
I
have
to
admit
that.
I
wrote
about
the
associations
in
my
journal
over
a
couple
of
days
after
the
dream.
In
the
end,
the
following
strangely
resonated:
●
The
leather
club
chair
is
in
Reid’s
office
and,
therefore,
represents
the
photography
world.
●
The
leather
chair
is
like
the
archetypal
snake
as
temptation
inviting
me
to
sit
down,
BUT
●
I
can’t
sit
on
the
chair
because
it
was
overflowing
with
ants
that
bite.
●
In
addition,
the
sticky
tree
sap
could
trap
me
like
a
Venus
flytrap,
and
I
would
be
unable
to
get
up
from
the
chair.
What
Does
this
Dream
Mean?
Taking
all
the
above
into
account,
I
now
believe
that
this
dream
is
sending
a
message
that
there
is
a
tug-of-war
between
photography
and
writing
in
the
interior
landscape
of
my
unconscious.
I
was
not
aware
of
this,
but
I
sense
that
this
conclusion
is
true.
The
dream
seems
to
be
saying
that
I
should
not
sit
on
the
photography
chair
because
of
the
biting
ants
and
the
sticky
tree
sap.
I
hesitated
moving
to
the
writer
chair,
so
that
appears
out
as
well.
The
dream
is
saying
that
I
have
to
find
my
own
path:
it’s
not
photography,
and
it’s
not
writing.
What
is
interesting
about
the
dream
is
that
it
actually
had
three
chairs:
the
chair
I
was
sitting
on
at
the
beginning
of
the
dream,
the
writer
chair,
and
the
photographer
chair.
The
question
now
is,
what
did
the
first
chair
represent?
I
don’t
know.
No
other
characters
spoke
during
the
dream.
I
will
have
to
think
about
it
in
the
coming
days.
Usually
in
dream
interpretation,
the
unconscious
leaves
a
little
clue
as
to
what
the
solution
is,
but
it’s
escaping
me
at
the
moment.
In
the
meantime,
I
completed
a
ritual
to
acknowledge
this
dream.
I
created
cyanotype
art
from
it.
