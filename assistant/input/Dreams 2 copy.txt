Common
Dreams
and
their
Meanings
People
have
long
theorized
on
the
meaning
of
dreams.
From
ancient
civilizations
to
modern
scientists.
Some
of
the
earliest
theories
of
dreaming
were
proposed
by
the
Greeks
and
Romans
who
believed
that
dreams
served
as
a
gateway
between
the
earthly
world
and
the
godly
realm.
In
ancient
Greece
and
Rome,
it
was
believed
that
dreams
had
prophetic
powers.
By
the
nineteenth
century
at
the
dawn
of
modern
psychology ,
Sigmund
Freud
and
Carl
Jung
developed
some
of
the
most
recognized
theories
of
dreaming.
Freud’ s
theory
was
based
on
the
idea
of
repressed
longing,
where
dreaming
allows
us
to
process
unresolved
and
repressed
wishes.
Carl
Jung,
also
believed
in
the
psychological
importance
of
dreams,
theorizing
that
they
are
the
psyche's
attempt
to
communicate
vital
information
to
the
person.
Over
the
twentieth
and
twenty-first
century
psychology
developed
and
went
through
numerous
paradigm
shifts.
During
this
period,
many
theories
of
dreaming
came
in
and
out
of
favor .
Currently ,
several
contrasting
theories
exist
with
wide
bodies
of
research
to
support
them,
such
as
the
“activation-synthesis
hypothesis,”
which
suggests
that
dreams
have
no
meaning
and
are
a
result
of
electrical
brain
impulses,
and
the
“threat
simulation
theory”,
which
suggests
dreams
gave
us
an
evolutionary
advantage,
helping
us
to
simulate
potential
threatening
events
and
figure
out
how
to
behave
to
gain
the
greatest
benefit.
Death
Dreams
of
dying
oneself
or
others
around
the
dreamer
dying
are
common
and
rather
disconcerting.
However ,
some
theories
suggest
that
death
in
dreams
is
a
positive
omen,
that
it
represents
change
and
letting
go
of
negative
aspects
of
the
dreamer ’s
life.

Other
interpretations
suggest
that
dreams
of
death
may
reflect
times
the
dreamer
is
feeling
anxiety
about
change
in
their
waking
life
or
that
they
are
currently
in
fear
of
the
unknown.
Falling
Studies
have
shown
that
dreams
in
which
the
dreamer
is
falling,
often
from
a
great
height,
are
also
common.
Most
interpretations
suggest
that
this
dream
is
not
a
favorable
one,
it
suggests
that
the
dreamer
considers
that
their
life
is
not
going
to
plan.
It
also
suggests
that
the
dreamer
may
benefit
from
rethinking
their
life
choices
and
assessing
the
current
path
they
are
on.
Dreams
of
falling
can
also
symbolize
a
need
to
let
go
and
enjoy
life
more.
Flying
Dreams
of
flying
can
evoke
feelings
of
excitement
as
well
as
fear.
This
represents
their
two
separate
meanings.
Sometimes,
dreams
of
flying
can
represent
feelings
of
liberation,
freedom,
and
independence,
which
can
be
enjoyable.
On
the
other
hand,
dreams
of
flying
can
also
symbolize
feelings
to
flee
or
escape
situations
in
real
life.
Losing
teeth
Most
people
will
have
experienced
at
least
one
dream
about
losing
teeth,
for
some
people
it
can
be
a
recurring
theme.
While
there
is
no
single
interpretation
of
this
dream,
it
can
often
symbolize
a
source
of
worry
in
the
dreamer ’s
waking
life.
Commonly ,
it
can
relate
to
concern
over
money ,
the
dreamer ’s
appearance,
or
the
dreamer ’s
ability
to
communicate.
Pregnancy

Both
women
and
men
can
experience
dreams
of
being
pregnant,
this
dream
theme
is
common
to
both
genders.
Dream
interpreters
disagree
on
the
meaning
of
this
dream,
some
believe
it
is
associated
with
creativity
and
others
suggest
it
is
linked
with
fear.
Also,
it
is
believed
that
the
meaning
of
this
dream
changes
depending
on
if
the
dreamer
is
actually
pregnant
or
not.
For
those
who
dream
of
being
pregnant
while
they
are
pregnant
in
real
life,
the
dream
may
reflect
anxieties
surrounding
pregnancy
and
birth.
Being
chased
Dreams
of
being
pursued
by
someone,
often
an
unknown
attacker ,
are
unfortunately
very
common.
The
interpretation
of
this
type
of
dream
suggests
that
it
symbolizes
that
the
dreamer
is
trying
to
avoid
something
in
their
waking
life.
It
also
may
represent
the
dreamer ’s
wish
to
escape
their
own
fears
or
desires.
The
identity
of
the
pursuer
can
help
identify
the
exact
meaning
of
the
dream.
Being
naked
in
public
One
of
the
most
common
dreams
is
that
of
suddenly
realizing
that
you
are
naked
in
public.
Dream
interpreters
suggest
that
this
frequently
occurring
dream
that
is
often
accompanied
by
feelings
of
panic
and
embarrassment
is
linked
to
the
feeling
of
being
phony
in
real
life.
The
dream
can
also
indicate
anxiety
of
the
dreamer ’s
imperfections
and
shortcomings
being
revealed.
Overall,
dreams
are
personal
to
the
dreamer
and
are
thought
to
reflect
on
the
individual
and
the
specific
situations
they
find
themselves
in
in
real
life.
Dream
interpretations
can
help
indicate
the
potential
meaning
of
a
dream,
but
the
dreamer
can
often
understand
the
dream
meaning
in
a
way
that
is
personal
to
them
through
self-reflection.
